# SOC-Home-Lab

## ðŸ“– Introduction
This project simulates a Security Operations Center (SOC) environment using **Wazuh Cloud** as the SIEM.  
I set up a monitored Ubuntu server with a Wazuh Agent, performed simulated attacks from a Kali Linux VM, and analyzed the resulting alerts.  

The goal was to gain hands-on experience with SIEM administration, detection engineering, and SOC analysis tasks.

##  Architecture

**Components:**
- **Kali Linux VM** â†’ attacker machine (used for brute force, privilege escalation, and scanning tests).
- **Ubuntu VM (Monitored Endpoint)** â†’ endpoint monitored with **Wazuh Agent installed here**.
- **Wazuh Cloud (SIEM)** â†’ centralized logging, correlation, and alerting.

**Architecture Flow**:
```plaintext
[Kali Linux (Attacker)]  â†’  [Ubuntu VM (Monitored Endpoint + Wazuh Agent)]  â†’  [Wazuh Cloud SIEM Dashboard]
```

**Tools & Technologies**

- Kali Linux â€“ adversary simulation (brute force, scanning, privilege escalation).
- Ubuntu Server â€“ monitored endpoint.
- Wazuh Agent â€“ installed on Ubuntu to forward logs.
- Wazuh Cloud â€“ SIEM for log correlation and alerting.
- MITRE ATT&CK â€“ mapped detections to adversary techniques.
